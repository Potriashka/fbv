# FIREBASE VERSION OF FIREMESS
## It is the terminal messenger developed by Peter Repiev
### Here you can chat with whoever you want. Just give your name and go ahead!
##### This project is still in the development. 100% working and completed version is firebaseversion.py but FULL version of firemess is in fbvFULL.py
#### First of all download all files through ```git clone https://github.com/Potriashka/fbv.git``` or by clicking "download zip" button (https://github.com/Potriashka/fbv/archive/main.zip)
#### To start you need to install all needed Python moduls by typing:
##### Windows
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
#maybe it won't work and you'll need to install all modules in old way
```
##### Linux
```python
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
#### and then with a short command
##### Windows:
```python
$ cd fbv
$ cd specVERS
$ py firebaseversion.py
```
##### Linux:
```python
$ cd fbv/
$ python3 fbvFULL.py
```
##### Phone:
You should download or copy to some IDE ```fbv.py``` in ```mobileVERS/``` then just run it and you'll be able to chat
###### (all the files will be downloaded in the same folder ```fbv.py``` is)
#### Notes:
